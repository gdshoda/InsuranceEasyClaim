      "      \"Gareds Basketball Backstops are the finest engineered in the industry, chosen worldwide by professional venues, universities, schools, park districts, and arenas. A T-shape fully welded extension arm and well designed uprights and base give this portable backstop unequal structural strength without the need for unsightly bridges and the clearest view of the game for fans that sit behind it. Operating System: The Gared Pro S is the finest engineered competition portable in the world utilizing the Gared tension spring technology. The maintenance-free tension spring mechanism is designed for balanced and effortless lifting/lowering of the unit. The unique mechanism is concealed inside the base for safety and appearance. Boom Extension: A superbly designed T-Shape extension arm made of fully welded, heavy wall rectangular tubing is patterned after Gareds original Gared Pro H, which is universally considered the most structurally stable competition portable. The T-Shape extension arm and heavy duty uprights eliminate the need for unsightly bridge supports, giving the fans a clear view of the court. Backboard: Model LXP4200 - official size 42\\\" x 72\\\" shatter proof rectangular glass backboard with a welded and reinforced steel frame. Half inch tempered glass with fired in target and border for maximum durability. Goal: Models 3500 and 3500I Master, positive lock breakaway goals come standard with these units for the domestic and international markets respectively. Model 3500I Master meets all FIBA standards. Padding: Durable GARED PRO-MOLD backboard edge padding. The base is fully padded on three sides with vinyl covered 2\\\" thick high density polyurethane foam. The front upright is similarly padded to a height of 7 with 5\\\" thick foam. Standard color for system padding is royal blue. Ballast: 1200 lbs. (544 kgs.) of ballast welded to and concealed in the base of the unit. Full weight with ballast 3000 lbs. (1361 kgs). Height Adjustable: Unique telescoping brace allows for preset heights of 8, 9 and 10. Adjustable Floor Pads: Two floor pads are encased in steel supports for added stability, and are controlled by a screw-type mechanism that raises the unit off the wheels and adjusts the unit to exactly 10 height. Floor Anchoring System: Floor anchors and locator pins are included as standard. Please specify floor type when ordering. Finish: The unit is powder-coated white. Transport & Storage: Folds easily for compact storage with double non-marking polyurethane casters for easy transport. Automatic Front Wheel Lift System: This included system is designed to make the basic installation and set up of the Gared Pro S effortless. It eliminates the need to adjust the leveling pads by automatically lifting the front wheels off the ground when the boom is raised to the play position and lower them when the boom is lowered to the folded or stored position. As the portable is raised, a cam operated mechanism raises the front wheels off the floor causing the boom to lock in the play position and the base to rest evenly on the supporting frame. Conversely when the wheels are in the down position the portable can be moved around. Approved or Meets Requirements: Meets NCAA, NAIA, NFHS and NBA main court specifications and is approved by FIBA for high level international competition.- SKU: GSPRT004 Gareds Basketball Backstops are the finest engineered in the industry, chosen worldwide by professional venues, universities, schools, park districts, and arenas.
